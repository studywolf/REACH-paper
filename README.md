# REACH-paper

This repository holds accompanying code to 'A spiking neural model of adaptive arm control'.

To perform the analyses required to generate the figures and data reported on in the paper, first download the required raw data (about 15GB total) from FigShare: https://figshare.com/projects/REACH-paper_data/16329
Once downloaded, create a folder called 'data' inside the analysis folder and unzip the data there. Once completed, you can run the Python script corresponding to the analysis you would like to perform from the analysis directory.
