'
A basic implementation of the REACH model (DeWolf et al, 2016) using
operational space control (OSC) to trace a circle generated by the pre-motor
cortex (PMC). The model has a spiking implementation of M1, CB, PMC, and a
simple S1 that just relays joint angle and velocity information.

The M1, CB, and PMC sub-networks are defined in the M1.py, CB.py, and PMC.py
files in the REACH folder, and should be read for further details on their
implementation.

In this model the PMC trajectory generation subsystem outputs a series of
target locations for the hand to follow that trace out a circle.

The framework.py file is called to connect the model components defined here
together. This architecture file was defined separately to reduce overlap
between examples.

To run this model, open in Nengo GUI.
